# Inventory-Demand-Forecasting

Global Mart is online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office. The purpose of this project is to understand the what categories of products are the most profitable and during which months they are the most profitable. I also want to understand what market segment is most profitable and what kind of products are the most profitable in those market segments. It would also be interesting to understand what days are the most profitable for the store across the world and also in particular market segments. All these analyses should help the store get a broader idea of their profitability across the world and what products are bringing the most revenue.
